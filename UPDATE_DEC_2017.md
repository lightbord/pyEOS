# Update - December 22, 2017.

Development of pyEOS may seem like it's stopped, but I promise it hasn't I have been quite busy with shows, and have even used the bits of pyEOS that are written in some of those shows. I have added tweaks which I'll publish as soon as possible. I'm also working to restructure it into a much more "proper" python library, including much better classes, properties, and more.

As always, any and all contributions are welcome.

So for now, Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year!
